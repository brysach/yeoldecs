The Wind-Weaver of the Mire

The gates of Aethelgard did not close with a clang, but with a whisper. It was the sound of a thousand perfectly oiled mechanisms sliding into place, a sound of final, effortless rejection. Elara knew the sound. She had helped design the wind-catchers that powered the gate's hydraulics.

Now, she stood on the outside.

Her city was a marvel of spun brass and white stone, built into the very spine of the world. It hung between the peaks, anchored by faith and engineering, a place where the only currency was the sky. Elara had been a master of that currency. As a Sky-Weaver, she read the wind, charted the unseen currents, and wove the great kinetic sails that powered the city's lifts and drew moisture from the clouds. She was not noble-born, but she had been essential.

Until the "Crimson Gust." A freak, un-forecasted storm that had torn a primary sail, sending a cargo lift—and the new Lord-Magister's prized statuary—crashing into the chasm below.
